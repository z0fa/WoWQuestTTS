# FAQS

### How can I add additional voices?

The add-on already lists all the installed voices in the system, if you manage to find some free third party voices you can try to install them and if they are compatible they should appear in the list. Unfortunately the availability of the voices is something out of the scope of the add-on.

> I used [this](https://www.ghacks.net/2018/08/11/unlock-all-windows-10-tts-voices-system-wide-to-get-more-of-them/) to add more voices (saw many others that search for that)
>
> However keep in mind that that has nothing to do with the addon. Adding the voices there make them to be usable for other programs on windows. So WoW can load it which means the addon can use it too.

### The TTS randomly stops working

It could be the windows TTS process not being active. Opening the "Speech" settings in Windows should fix the problem (credits: BiktiBikti)
