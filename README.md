# FAQS

### How can I add additional voices?

The add-on automatically lists all voices installed on your system. If you find free third-party voices, you can try installing them. If they are compatible, they should appear in the list. Please note that the availability of voices is beyond the scope of this add-on.

> I used [this](https://www.ghacks.net/2018/08/11/unlock-all-windows-10-tts-voices-system-wide-to-get-more-of-them/) to add more voices (saw many others that search for that)
>
> However keep in mind that that has nothing to do with the addon. Adding the voices there make them to be usable for other programs on windows. So WoW can load it which means the addon can use it too.

### The TTS randomly stops working

This may happen if the Windows TTS process is not active. Opening the "Speech" settings in Windows should fix the problem. (credits: BiktiBikti)
